# Annex

Annex is a testing platform for managing remote execution of integration tests with fully replayable history.

## Running

```shell
go run main.go all -config-file=local.yaml
```

## Disclaimer

Annex is currently considered as a proof of concept and is not intended for serious use at this stage. Corners have
purposefully been cut to allow for rapid development, which means major/breaking changes are to be expected.
